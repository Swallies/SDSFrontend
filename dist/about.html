                <p>Hey there my name is Herman, I am 25 years old and I am Student at the University of Bremen in Germany, where I study Digital Media. I have always enjoyed video games ever since I was young and because of that I decided to study Digital Media so I could develop my own games someday! </p>

                <h3>Current Semester</h3>
                <h6>I am in Finland!</h6>
                <p>
                    This semester was very special for me, as I spent an entire semester in the lovely country of Finland! In total I just spent a little over 4 months here in Finland from August 25th to December 26th. I really enjoyed the cold weather and all the beautiful snow throughout the beginning of winter. Sadly I didn't meet to many new people and alot of my courses were online self study courses, which meant that I didn't really go to the University all that often. But aside from that it was awesome!

                <h3>Games</h3>
                <h6>What I like to do in my free time</h6>
                <p>
                    In my free time I love playing all kind of games! I enjoy classic fantasy tabletop games such as Pathfinder and D&D, Trading Card Games like Magic: The Gathering, but also video games which I usually play on my PC. Enjoying my free time playing video games with my friends is the best and I could'nt imagine doing anything else :D
